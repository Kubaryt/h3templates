        <p class="templshortdescr">mt_Nebula 1.1 is template created by wnukos for purpose of continuation the mt_Andromeda 2.1/2.2 movement.  It's something like mt_Andromeda v2. <br> Main diffrence from versions 2.1/2.2 is that you can play this template with or without AI. Other diffrences are that banned some artifacts, skills and objects, there is guaranted Conflux and some trivia. There are same spells bans as in TP versions so there is max 3 rolls for Town Portal and max 4 rolls for Dimension Doors in Rampart, Inferno and Necropolis, 5 in Tower and Dungeon and 6 in Conflux.</p>
