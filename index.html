                    <div id="leftdescr-6lm10a" style="display: none;">
                        <p><img class="templsmallgraph" src="img/graphs/6lm10e.png"><br/>This is one of the most popular XL+U templates. Map layout is heavily branched, and therefore there is no distinct centre. <br>Vast territories are available for players’ exploration, which makes this template quite well-balanced. Both players explore, conduct spell research and usually don’t contact each other, unless one of them does it intentionally. <br>There is some variety in zones: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>4 gold zones being the most valuable, but hard to access, because all connections that lead there are imperatively roadless.</li>
                            <li>8 silver zones are second most valuable. There is higher chance for utopias in them, and they usually contains more creature banks (especially Wolf Raiders' Pickets and Dragon Flies' Hives). They are easier to get, because they are always connected to at least one zone.</li>
                            <li>White and ai zones are least valueable, but the first ones have resources mines. They are good gold sources for early game. They also has quite good chance for generating a Grffin Conservatory or Experimental Shop.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div id="leftdescr-8xm12a" style="display: none;">
                        <p><img class="templsmallgraph" src="img/graphs/8xm12TP.png"><br/>This is an XL+U template with vast topology and branching road network, where players are considered to explore the territory and research spells.<br>The template has a rich central treasure zone (with Relic artifacts inside) and several poorer treasure zones. <br>Zone types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 gold zone - the most valuable, but hard to acces. All connections leading to it are offroad. Because of hard acces and high value of content which means high value of guards it's mid-/endgame target,</li>
                            <li>12 silver zones - second most valueable. They are easier to get than gold zone and have less guarded, but also good content and one town. There are 3 silver zones for every magical resource,</li>
                            <li>AI and white zones - least valueable. They have less value of content than any other zones, but that makes them good gold, Griffin Conservatories and Experimental Shops source for early game.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div id="leftdescr-h3dm1" style="display: none;">
                        <p><img class="templsmallgraph" src="img/graphs/h3dm3.png"><br/>One of the most popular mirror templates. This template follows a simple gameplan: starting zone > secondary town zone > treasure zone.<br>Although, early contact is not guaranteed due to complicated map topology, so players are forced to clear the treasure zones and conduct spell research, as on XL+U maps. This template is considered to be among the most balanced ones.<br>Zone types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>12 gold zones - the most valueable. All connections on this template are road connections, so getting to them isn't really hard. It's common practice to, after finding a zone with premium content, steal its content from oponents side of mirror,</li>
                            <li>6 white zones and players zones - less valueable, but you have to claim them anyway, cuz' they lead to gold zones. They have low value content, so they are also good gold source for early game.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div id="leftdescr-mt_Andromeda" style="display: none">
                        <p><img class="templsmallgraph" src="img/graphs/mt_Nebula.png">This is a mirror XL+U template, suitable for long and rather contactless games, heavily based on exploration and spell research.<br>Due to having underground tunnels replaced by fully functional surface layer, this template generates maps effectively bigger than regular XL+U, which is compensated by having obligatory roads for every connection.<br>Template can be played with or without AI. In case of playing with AIs, AI zones are white zones between silver and white zones.<br>Zone types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>12 silver zones - most valueable, but less valuable than usual. They have more higher tier banks (like Dragon Flies' Hive  or Wolf Raiders' Picket) and Utopias are most likely to be found in them. As on h3dm1 its good to, after finding a zone with premium content, steal it from oponents side of mirror.</li>
                            <li>3 inner white zones - they have same valueability as outher white zones, but in case of playing with AI they are AI zones and in both cases they have town with fort. They are good gold and less valueable banks (like Grffin Conservatory or Experimental Shop) source in early game,</li>
                            <li>3 outher white zones - they have same valueability as inner white zones, but they have town without forts. Other diffrence is that the white zone which is dirrectly oposite player starting zone always has Conflux village. They are good gold and less valueable banks (like Grffin Conservatory or Experimental Shop) source in early game,</li>
                            <li>Players' zones - they have same valueability as white zones. They also are good gold and less valuable banks source for early game.</li>
